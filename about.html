			<h3>Our History</h3>
			<p title="Our History" id="our_history">In 1951, Lloyd L. Antle, an Ohio University graduate and Professor of Marketing at Georgia State University, conceived of the idea that the sales profession should have a professional fraternity of its own. After over a year of planning with the support of three of his colleagues, Pi Sigma Epsilon was established on May 14, 1952.
			<br> <br>
			Pi Sigma Epsilon (PSE) is the only national, co-ed, professional business fraternity in sales, marketing, and management. PSE offers practical sales and marketing experience to members through active involvement in sales and marketing projects, marketing research, professional programs, and social events.
			<br> <br>
			The Zeta Chi chapter of PSE was started by Sabrina Ruiz in Feruary 2013. She observed a lack of marketing, sales, and retail management courses and organizations on campus despite the numer of interested students and recruiters, and believed PSE could be the solution. To make this idea into a reality, she recruited Kelly Chao, Cynthia Huang, Lydia Kim, Peggy Lin, and Hiu Ngan to promote the chapter's founding.
