## Git & GitHub

## Immediate Changes
- Connect the mLab MongoDB databases to Google Spreadsheets for easier collaboration

## Changes within a Semester
- When the Facebook recruitment application goes live, update the `FB_EVENT_LINK` in the `AppBanner` component
- Open & close the recruitment application as necessary
- When the recruitment application is closed, be sure to update the Pre-Registration form and mLab MongoDB database with the next semester's information

## Changes between Semesters
- Update the [Recruitment](https://github.com/BerkeleyPSE/BerkeleyPSE.github.io/blob/5923f9a479e63f94b6e41fe3b523f4928b0788f3/client/src/components/Recruitment/Recruitment.jsx) timeline
- Update the [Brotherhood](https://github.com/BerkeleyPSE/BerkeleyPSE.github.io/blob/5923f9a479e63f94b6e41fe3b523f4928b0788f3/client/src/components/Brothers/Brotherhood.jsx) page with the newly-crossed class members
- Update the [Executives](https://github.com/BerkeleyPSE/BerkeleyPSE.github.io/blob/5923f9a479e63f94b6e41fe3b523f4928b0788f3/client/src/components/Brothers/Executives.jsx) page with the new members (if necessary)

## Future Changes
- An "Experiences" table should be added to each brother's profile in the `Brother` component
- An "Internships" table should be added to the `Careers` page
- The landing page should utilize [fullpage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js) for the slides rather than `react slick` if the design is to remain
