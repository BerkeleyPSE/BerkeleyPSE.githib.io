		<h3>Why PSE?</h3>
		<p>Differentiating itself from numerous other business fraternities and marketing organizations on campus, Pi Sigma Epsilon focuses specifically on marketing, management, and sales. Our brothers come from many different majors but all share one commonality: a passion for marketing, sales, or retail, and motivation to succeed. As a PSE brother you will have access to training, resources, networking, recruitment and internship opportunities with some of the largest companies in these industries.

		<h3>FAQs</h3>
		
		<h4>What makes PSE different from other organizations?</h4>
		<p>PSE differentiates itself from other business fraternities and organizations both in its learning philosophy and specialization. We prepare our brothers with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in today's business world, but go further to provide opportunities to utilize and hone these skills within projects across various industries. PSE hosts networking opportunities and corporate infosessions with professionals and alumni, and puts its members in positions to become their best possible professional selves.
		<br>
		But PSE provides far more than professional development - as a fraternity, we are an intimate, close-knit environment where brothers can build strong personal relationships, and lasting friendships.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What do you look for in recruits?</h4>
		<p>There is no one "type" of person that will ensure advantage over other recruits. Zeta Chi is strong because of a diversity of majors, backgrounds, strengths, and interests. We primarily look for a good culture fit among our brotherhood, a genuine interest in business and our industries, and commitment and motivation to PSE.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Why do you not use terms such as "rush" or "pledge"?</h4>
		<p>PSE is a professional fraternity, and thus we choose to use terminology that reflects our professional attitude, character, and purpose. Terms such as "recruitment," "prospective member," "prospective member training," and "PM Trainer," are used in lieu of "rush," "pledge," "pledge process," and "pledgemaster," in any verbal or written communication involving participation or membership in Pi Sigma Epsilon.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What is the time commitment for a prospective member?</h4>
		<p>The time commitment for a prospective member (PM) generally ranges from 3-10 hours per week outside of a weekly 2-hour PM training on Monday nights.</p>
			
		<h4>Will I be hazed as a prospective member?</h4>
		<p><strong>Absolutely not.</strong> PSE treats its prospective members with respect. We actively encourage our PMs to partake in other enjoyable activities. Our PMs should not sacrifice their mental or physical health, or academic lives for PSE. <a href="https://twitter.com/ASUC_Union/status/646418648219942912" target="_blank">#BearsDontHaze</a>
